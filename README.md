BudgetLoc - project for distributed systems

The folder named "BudgetLoc Web Server - Python" contains all the code in Python, 
with Flask framework integrated, that runs in the server, with the algorithm included. 
The main file is __init__.py, and the other folders include HTML templates and JavaScript and CSS files.
The folder named "budgetlocAndroidApp" contains the code for setting up BudgetLoc as an Android application, 
so that the user does not have to enter the URL in the browser. 

The application is also up and running in a real Amazon EC2 instance, using Apache Web Server. 
It can be accessed at: http://ec2-52-25-46-212.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
